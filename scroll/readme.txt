Desc:
The Infinite Product Scroll extension will auto-load products in your shop as your customer scrolls down the page.  This keeps your customers from being required to navigate to different pages to view your products.  If they scroll through all of your products, they will all be shown on the same page.

Installation:
The Infinite Product Scroll extension installs just like any other wordpress plugin. Simply upload the zip file through your 
administration section and activate the plugin. Once activated, the extension will automatically work on your shop page, category pages, and tag pages.

Setup:
There is no required setup beyond activating the plugin.  Upon activation, the Infinite Product Scroll effect will happen on your shop page, category pages, and tag pages.
